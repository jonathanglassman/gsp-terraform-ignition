# Getting started with a GDS Supported Platform cluster

## Before you start

You must have:

- a Docker image of you app built in line with the [12 factor principles](/architecture.html#12-factor-application-principles)
- access to a [Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/alphagov/gsp-terraform-ignition/blob/master/docs/gds-supported-platform/troubleshooting_app_errors.md) created by Tech Ops

## Create a Github repo

You must create a repository on Github to store your Deployment configuration. The GDS Supported Platform only works with repos stored on Github.

### Request namespace

Your service team's Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) must [ask GDS Tech Ops](re-GSP-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) for a new namespace. You must provide the following information (undefined):

* your [GitHub repository address](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-remote-repositories)
* the name of the [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) you want to create
* the email addresses, Github names, and [GPG public keys](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html) (if applicable) of the list of users who should get read-only access to the namespace

### Create a Helm chart

The GDS Supported Platform uses a packaging format called [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/developing_charts/). A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.

Charts are created as files laid out in a directory tree. These files are then packaged into versioned archives that users can deploy.

1. Create a root directory in your Github repo. This directory will contain the chart.

1. Create a `Chart.yaml` file in the root directory with the following code:

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    appVersion: "1.0"
    description: CHART_DESCRIPTION
    name: CHART_NAME
    version: 0.1.0
    ```

    This file defines metadata about the chart.

1. Create a `templates` directory in the root directory. This directory contains all Kubernetes object definitions.

1. Create a `values.yaml` file in the root directory. This file will set the default values for your desired chart variables.

### Create a Kubernetes Deployment object in the templates directory

You run an app by creating a [Kubernetes Deployment object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/#kubernetes-objects). This object defines your app and its routes, databases and all other relevant information. You describe a Deployment in a YAML file.

1. Create a `deployment.yaml` file in the `templates` directory. The following example uses an nginx container image, `myapp`, in place of your app image:

    ```
    apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: {{ .Release.Name }}-myapp
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp
        app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name }}
    spec:
      replicas: {{ .Values.replicas }}
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp
          app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name }}
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name }}
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: myappcontainer
              image: "nginx:latest" #Replace this with your app image
              ports:
                - name: http
                  containerPort: 80
                  protocol: TCP
    ```

    The `{{ .Release.Name }}` and `{{ .Values.replicas }}` variables are populated automatically when you render the chart.

1. Run the following in the root directory to render the chart:

    ```
    helm template --name example .
    ```

1. Check `stdout` to see if the chart rendered correct.

### Create a service

By default, your apps are not accessible to the public. To expose them to the public, you must set up a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and an [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) into the Kubernetes cluster.

Create a `service.yaml` file in the `templates` directory with the following code:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-APP_NAME
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: APP_NAME
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name }}
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 80 _ALWAYS PORT 80???_
      targetPort: http
      protocol: TCP
      name: http
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: APP_NAME
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name }}
```
The `{{ .Release.Name }}` variable is populated automatically when we render the chart.

You have created a stable endpoint to direct public internet traffic to.

### Create an Ingress

You must define an Ingress to route public internet traffic to the stable endpoint that you created when you defined the Service.

Create a `ingress.yaml` file in the `templates` directory with the following code:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-myapp
  annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: "/"
spec:
  rules:
  - host:  {{ .Release.Name }}.{{ .Values.global.cluster.domain }}
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: example-myapp
          servicePort: 80
        path: /
```

### Deploy your app

You can deploy your app once Tech Ops has created your namespace and you have created a:

- Helm chart
- Kubernetes Deployment object
- Service
- Ingress

To deploy your app, commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

Check that your app is live at {{ .Release.Name }}.{{ .Values.global.cluster.domain }}.

### View your app in the dashboard

You can view your app in the Dashboard without needing to go through the Service or Ingress that you set up. You do this by using a proxy to access your Kubernetes cluster.

Run the following to use a proxy to access your Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl proxy
```

Kubectl will make your Dashboard available at http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/.

To access your dashboard, see the [GSP documentation on accessing dashboards](https://github.com/alphagov/gsp-terraform-ignition/blob/master/docs/gds-supported-platform/accessing-dashboard.md).
